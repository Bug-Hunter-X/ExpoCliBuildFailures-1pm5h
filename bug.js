While building an Expo app, I encountered an error related to the 'metro-resolver' package.  The error message wasn't very specific, just indicating a failure during the resolution process.  This occurred inconsistently, sometimes working fine and other times failing after seemingly minor code changes. Cleaning the cache and reinstalling dependencies did not resolve it. The exact error message varied but generally indicated a problem finding a module or package.
