// bugSolution.js
// This file provides a potential solution for the described build issues.
// The problem often stems from dependency conflicts or incorrect configurations.

// Solution Steps:
// 1. Review package.json and ensure all dependencies are compatible. Pay special attention to those related to Metro Bundler.
// 2. Check for version conflicts using a dependency resolution tool (like npm-check-updates or yarn why).
// 3. If conflicts exist, carefully upgrade or downgrade packages to resolve discrepancies.  Prioritize maintaining compatibility across all dependencies.
// 4.  Consider simplifying dependencies to reduce potential for conflicts. Remove unused dependencies.
// 5.  Clean the cache: `expo prebuild --clean`
// 6. Rebuild the project: `expo start`

// Example (Illustrative): Assume a conflict between 'react-native-vector-icons' and 'react-native-safe-area-context'

// package.json before fixing:
// ...
// "react-native-vector-icons": "^7.1.0",
// "react-native-safe-area-context": "^3.3.2",
// ...

// package.json after fixing (example - specific versions may vary):
// ...
// "react-native-vector-icons": "^7.1.0",
// "react-native-safe-area-context": "^4.4.1",
// ...

// After applying this fix, rebuild the project and verify if the problem is solved.
